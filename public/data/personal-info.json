    "longBio": "I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with a deep passion for creating exceptional user experiences through modern web technologies. With over 11 years in the industry, I've mastered the React and Angular ecosystems, focusing on performance optimization, accessibility standards, and scalable design systems.\n\nMy journey spans from individual contributor to technical leader, where I've successfully delivered 50+ projects, mentored 20+ developers, and established frontend best practices across multiple organizations. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating components that not only function perfectly but also delight users with smooth animations and intuitive interactions.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open source projects, writing technical blogs, or speaking at frontend conferences about performance optimization and modern development practices.",
